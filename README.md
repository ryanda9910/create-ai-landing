## What's inside

Every scaffold ships two layers on top of each other:

**AI system files** — framework-agnostic, always included:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Session briefing — brand, stack, workflow rules |
| `DESIGN.md` | Design system ground truth (colors, type, spacing, motion) |
| `GUARDRAILS.md` | Failure memory — pre-loaded with common AI mistakes |
| `.claude/skills/copywriter` | Role constraints for copy tasks |
| `.claude/skills/qa-mobile` | Role constraints for mobile QA |
| `.claude/skills/ui-designer` | Role constraints for UI work |
| `scripts/check-design-tokens` | Blocks hardcoded hex values at commit |

**Framework source** — pre-wired to your brand:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/site.ts` | Single source of truth for brand name, domain, email |
| `src/components/` | Hero, Services, Process, Contact, Header, Footer |
| API route | Zod-validated contact form + honeypot spam protection |

## Supported frameworks

| | Framework | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| ⬛ | **Next.js 14** (App Router) | SSR, API routes, SEO-heavy pages |
| 🟠 | **Astro 4** | Static sites, best Lighthouse scores |
| 🔵 | **Vite + React** | SPA, client-side only |
| ⬜ | **Vanilla JS** | No framework, minimal, fast |

## UI library support

Choose your component system at scaffold time. Deps are injected into `package.json` and providers are wired up automatically.

| UI Library | Next.js | Astro | Vite + React | Vanilla |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Tailwind CSS** *(default)* | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **shadcn/ui** | ✅ | — | ✅ | — |
| **Ant Design 5** | ✅ | — | ✅ | — |
| **Material UI 6** | ✅ | — | ✅ | — |
| **Mantine 7** | ✅ | — | ✅ | — |
| **Chakra UI 3** | ✅ | — | ✅ | — |
| **daisyUI 4** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| **Bootstrap 5** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **None** *(plain CSS)* | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

Provider setup, `components.json`, and `UI_SETUP.md` are generated per choice — no manual wiring.

## What gets personalized

| Variable | Example |
|---|---|
| `BRAND_NAME` | Volta Studio |
| `TAGLINE` | Every beat tells a story. |
| `PRIMARY_COLOR` | #1A1A2E |
| `ACCENT_COLOR` | #E94560 |
| `CITY` | Bandung |
| `DOMAIN` | voltastudio.com |
| `EMAIL` | hello@voltastudio.com |

## After scaffolding

```bash
cd my-project
pnpm install

# Complete your design system:
#   DESIGN.md     → fill in type scale, spacing, component patterns
#   src/lib/      → add real content (services, work samples, testimonials)
#   GUARDRAILS.md → grows as you build

pnpm dev
```

## Why this exists

AI output quality is a function of the constraints you give it.

```
Slop     = AI + no context
Not slop = AI inside a design system + guardrails + concrete specs
```

A crucible is the vessel where raw material transforms into refined output. Your brand inputs go in, a constrained AI-ready scaffold comes out. The walls are set. The AI works inside them.
